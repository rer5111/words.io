Hello! This game was done as a college project so dont expect too much, I'm still learning.
Anyways here are some installation instructions:
You are going to need 2 things:
1. Python
2. Pygame

Python can be installed from the official site (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
After you installed python you have to open a command prompt and type "pip install pygame". If you've done that correctly, the game should run without issues.
If you encounter any bugs, make sure to report it to me directly through my social media accounts, or create an issue on the github page (make sure to include how to replicate the bug and test it multiple times).
If you have a suggestion, you can leave it under the games page or make an issue on github.
